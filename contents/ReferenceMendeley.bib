abstract = {An updated global bathymetry and topography grid is presented using a spatial sampling interval of 15 arc sec. The bathymetry is produced using a combination of shipboard soundings and depths predicted using satellite altimetry. New data consists of >33.6 million multibeam and singlebeam measurements collated by several institutions, namely, the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology, Geoscience Australia, Center for Coastal and Ocean Mapping, and Scripps Institution of Oceanography. New altimetry data consists of 48, 14, and 12 months of retracked range measurements from Cryosat-2, SARAL/AltiKa, and Jason-2, respectively. With respect to SRTM15_PLUS (Olson et al.,), the inclusion of these new data results in a ∼1.4-km improvement in the minimum wavelength recovered for sea surface free-air gravity anomalies, a small increase in the accuracy of altimetrically derived predicted depths, and a 1.24% increase, from 9.60% to 10.84%, in the total area of ocean floor that is constrained by shipboard soundings at 15-arc sec resolution. Bathymetric grid cells constrained by satellite altimetry have estimated uncertainties of ±150 m in the deep oceans and ±180 m between coastlines and the continental rise. Onshore, topography data are sourced from previously published digital elevation models, predominately SRTM-CGIAR V4.1 between 60°N and 60°S. ArcticDEM is used above 60°N, while Reference Elevation Model of Antarctica is used below 62°S. Auxiliary grids illustrating shipboard data coverage, marine free-air gravity anomalies, and vertical gradient gradients are also provided in common data formats.},

abstract = {The impact of horizontal resolution (1/12° to 1/50°; 6 to 1.5 km at midlatitudes) on Gulf Stream separation, penetration, and variability is quantified in a series of identical North Atlantic experiments. The questions the authors seek to address are twofold: 1) Is the realism of the modeled solution increased as resolution is increased? 2) How robust is the modeled mesoscale and submesoscale eddy activity as a function of grid spacing and how representative is it of interior quasigeostrophic (QG) or surface quasigeostrophic (SQG) turbulence? This study shows that (i) the representation of Gulf Stream penetration and associated recirculating gyres shifts from unrealistic to realistic when the resolution is increased to 1/50° and when the nonlinear effects of the submesoscale eddies intensifies the midlatitude jet and increases its penetration eastward, (ii) the penetration into the deep ocean drastically increases with resolution and closely resembles the observations, and (iii) surface power spectra in the 70–250-km mesoscale range are independent of the horizontal resolution and of the latitude and are representative of 2D QG and SQG turbulence.},

Recent studies have predicted that energy equation in B{\"{o}}dewadt flow can have physically compatible solution only when disk is porous. We utilize the usual von-K{\'{a}}rm{\'{a}}n variables to transform the governing equations of fluid motion and heat transfer (with variable properties) into self-similar differential equations. The final problem comprises of a parameter $\theta$e that measures the degree of dependence of fluid viscosity on temperature. A numerical approach is pursued to determine velocity components, wall stresses, temperature and heat transfer rate from the disk. Wall suction velocity is found to have a pivotal role on the solutions. The main outcome of the study is that fluid velocity and temperature around the disk are considerably altered by varying the parameter $\theta$e. The deviations of present results from those obtained with constant fluid properties are deliberated. Present results are in perfect agreement with the available literature in a limiting sense.},

abstract="The Seven Basic Equations represent the spatial and temporal dimensions of atmospheric motion, energy, and moisture, and are solved simultaneously in numerical weather prediction at many grid points in the atmosphere. The first three equations are collectively known as the Reynolds Equations of Motion. They solve for the time rate of change of wind speed in the west-to-east, south-to-north, and down-to-up direction at each grid point, as a function of the rate of advection and convection of wind, the pressure gradient force, the Coriolis effect, and the impact of friction. The fourth is the Thermodynamic Energy Equation. It expresses the sum of the internal energy of the individual molecules comprising the atmosphere and the kinetic energy that drives the macro-scale motion of the atmosphere (i.e., the wind). The Moisture Conservation Equation states that the change in moisture content at a grid point is equal to the sum of the contribution of moisture via advection and the contribution via phase changes. The sixth equation is most commonly known as the Continuity Equation or Mass Conservation Equation, which computes the time rate of change of density as a function of density advection in the west-to-east, south-to-north, and down-to-up directions, respectively, and the velocity convergence/divergence in the same three directions. The final equation, the Equation of State for an Ideal Gas, is the ``glue'' that binds the other equations because it relates pressure, density (or its reciprocal, specific volume), and temperature. A few of the most commonly used numerical weather prediction models are reviewed.",

The method of characteristics (MOC) is applied for the analysis of two transient categories, where the governing one-dimensional, hyperbolic conservation equations are linearized and solved without neglecting any of their term. First, we present a parametric study of the pressurized flow encountered when pipelines are utilized for the transportation or the temporary storage of natural gas. The non-ideal compressibility of natural gas is included in the model and its impact on the thermo-hydraulic processes is elucidated. Second, we model the hydrodynamics of a pipeline whose downstream boundary is a periodic discharge rate. The results show that, in response to these boundary conditions, the pressure distribution in the pipeline also undergoes periodic variations. Furthermore, our simulation results confirm the usefulness of MOC for numerical simulation of flow phenomena in pipelines. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

Airfoil is a part that influences the lifting force on the wing of the aircraft. Therefore, in this study should be conducted a study of three different forms of airfoil, about the behaviour of the fluid flow around it, numerically. The approach to fluid flow behaviour can be done using the Navier-Stokes equation. The airflow velocity around the airfoil is the fluid flow behaviour to be analysed, so the numerical solution can be obtained through Finite Element Method (FEM), then it is simulated with COMSOL Multiphysics 5.2a software. Thus, the simulation results will show the interrelations between the angle of attack ($\alpha$) which varies with the maximum velocity distribution on each airfoil surface, and can be seen the most stable maximum velocity distribution among the three airfoil forms.},

Conceptual-level multidisciplinary design optimization is first performed to size the strut-braced-wing aircraft for a design mission similar to the Embraer E190-E2, with a design range of 3,100 nmi at a maximum capacity of 104 passengers, and a maximum payload of 30,200 lb. For direct performance comparisons, a conventional tube-and-wing regional jet is also sized and optimized based on the same reference aircraft. Gradient-based aerodynamic shape optimization is then performed on wing-body-tail models of each aircraft, with the objective of drag minimization at cruise over a 500 nmi nominal mission. Design variables include twist and section shape degrees of freedom, which are realized through a free-form and axial deformation geometry control system, while nonlinear constraints include constant lift, zero pitching moment, minimum wing volume, and minimum maximum thickness-to-chord ratios. Results indicate that the optimizer is capable of mitigating shock formation, boundary-layer separation, and other flow interference effects from each wing design, including those within the wing-strut junction of the strut-braced wing. With current technology levels, the strut-braced-wing regional jet offers a 15.6% improvement in cruise lift-to-drag ratio over the equivalent conventional tube-and-wing aircraft, which translates to a 6.5% reduction in block fuel for the nominal mission.},

This paper deals with a numerical study on aerodynamic characteristics of the Horas Mesin USU. The numerical analyses are carried out by solving the governing equations using CFD FLUENT commercial code. The turbulent flow is closed using k-epsilon turbulence model. In the results, pathline, velocity vector and pressure distribution are plotted. By using the pressure distributions, drag and lift coefficients are calculated. In order to make a comparison, the aerodynamic characteristics of the present design are compared with commercial city car Ford-Fiesta. The averaged drag coefficients of Horas Mesin USU and Ford-Fiesta are 0.24320 and 0.29598, respectively. On the other hand, the averaged lift coefficients of the Horas Mesin USU and Ford-Fiesta are 0.03192202 and 0.09485621, respectively. This fact suggests that Ford-Fiesta has a better aerodynamic performance in comparison with Horas Mesin USU.

To predict the positive slope characteristics with an improved accuracy, a modified Partially-Averaged Navier-Stokes (MPANS) model is employed to capture the unstable physics in a pump-turbine. It is confirmed that the present numerical method predicts the positive slope characteristics in the pump-turbine fairly well compared with the experimental data. It is noted that at the drooping point of the performance curve (positive slope), there are three sets of rotating stall cells in the flow passages of both the guide vanes and stay vanes. In the guide vane region, the flow is completely shut off by the rotating stall, whereas in the stay vane region, the flow passage is partly blocked at the drooping point. The numerical results also reveal that the remarkable variation and high angle of attack (AOA) values upstream the leading edge of the guide vane contribute to the flow separation at the vane suction side and induce rotating stall in the flow passage within the positive slope region. Furthermore, the propagation of the rotating stall is depicted by both Eulerian and Lagrangian viewpoints: the rotating stall blocks the flow passage between two neighboring guide vanes and pushes the flow toward the leading edge of the subsequent guide vane. The rotating stall cell shifts along the rotational direction with a much lower frequency (0.146f n ) compared with the runner rotational frequency, f n .},

abstract = {In this paper, it was considered the numerical modeling of concentration propagation using solid barriers and porous barriers of different heights in an idealized urban canyon to protect nearby houses. To solve this problem, a modification of the Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations was used to take into account the properties of the porous medium. To validate the mathematical model, a test problem was solved without taking into account various barriers. After validation, the main problem was solved, describing the process of pollutants emission between houses when using different types of vegetation barriers (solid and porous). All the obtained numerical results were compared with each other using different types of vegetation barriers. And the optimal porosity properties and permeability coefficient for vegetation barriers have been determined. So, from the obtained results, it can be noted that when using a solid green fence with a height of 0.1H, it was found that the concentration indicator significantly decreased compared to the results without barriers. But when comparing the indicators of the spread of the concentration with porous barriers after a height of 0.1H, a tendency to decrease in the maximum concentration is noticeable, but the average value of the concentration almost does not change.},

@article{Kantha2019,
abstract = {Turbulent mixing in the upper layers of the northern Bay of Bengal is affected by a shallow layer overlying the saline waters of the Bay, which results from the huge influx of freshwater from major rivers draining the Indian subcontinent and from rainfall over the Bay during the summer monsoon. The resulting halocline inhibits wind-driven mixing in the upper layers. The brackish layer also alters the optical properties of the water column. Air-sea interaction in the Bay is expected to play a significant role in the intraseasonal variability of summer monsoons over the Indian subcontinent, and as such the sea surface temperature (SST) changes during the summer monsoon are of considerable scientific and societal importance. In this study, data from the heavily instrumented Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI) mooring, deployed at 18oN, 89.5oE in the northern Bay from December 2014 to January 2016, are used to drive a one-dimensional mixing model, based on second moment closure model of turbulence, to explore the intra-annual variability in the upper layers. The model results highlight the importance of the optical properties of the upper layers (and hence the penetration of solar insolation in the water column), as well as the temperature and salinity in the upper layers prescribed at the start of the model simulation, in determining the SST in the Bay during the summer monsoon. The heavy rainfall during the summer monsoon also plays an important role. The interseasonal and intraseasonal variability in the upper layers of the Bay are contrasted with those in the Arabian Sea, by the use of the same model but driven by data from an earlier deployment of a WHOI mooring in the Arabian Sea at 15.5 oN, 61.5 oE from December 1994 to December 1995.},

abstract = {This paper introduces the cumulative impact of cyclonic (cold-core) and anticyclonic (warm-core) eddies on the distribution of phytoplankton biomass in the Bay of Bengal (BoB). Estimations of the ocean surface eddy features in the BoB using satellite-derived monthly, seasonal, and multi-year (2012–2016) datasets showed significant dominance of warm-core features over the cold-core ones. Multi-year monthly data of the BoB evidenced strikingly higher geographical area (%) for warm cores (av. 16.5 ± 5.5) compared to the cold-core features (av. 2 ± 1.2). The highest warm-core extent (%) was in May (av. 25.8 ± 1.4), followed by April (av. 22.6 ± 1.4), February (av. 19.5 ± 0.3) and March (av. 18.3 ± 0.9). Contrastingly, a relatively higher extent (%) of cold cores occurred in November (av. 3.9 ± 2.2), October (av. 3.78 ± 2.0), and December (av. 3.5 ± 2.1). The analysis also showed that the extreme oligotrophy of the study domain during the Pre-Monsoon (March-May) was caused by a robust, warm gyre. Upwelling and winter convection, which enhances phytoplankton biomass in the Arabian Sea, are either very weak or absent in the BoB. Similarly, nutrient inputs through river influx into the BoB are insufficient to enhance phytoplankton stock beyond the shelf waters. In this scenario, we showed here that the significantly larger spread of warm-core over the cold-core eddies is a simple ecological indicator of the basin-scale low phytoplankton stock in the BoB.},

Sensitivity experiments using an ocean general circulation model are carried out for this purpose in the Indian ocean around 65°–95°E, 5°–22°N during 1998–2014 (17 years). In the absence of near surface wind forcing, the sea surface temperature of the region greatly increases in all the seasons, whereas, in the absence of incoming shortwave radiation forcing, exactly opposite is the case. The sea surface salinity of the AS and BoB decreases in the absence of wind and shortwave radiation forcings, whereas, in the northern BoB it increases in the absence of freshwater flux forcing. The sub-surface changes in the stratification of temperature and salinity are also investigated. The influence of the air-sea forcings on the mixed layer depth of the region is found to be highly seasonally dependent. The effect of air-sea forcings on the seasonal variability of the upper ocean vertical stability is studied using the vertical shear of the horizontal velocity, buoyancy frequency, and energy required for mixing as quantifiers. The near surface wind forcing has highest contribution in changing the surface circulation of the region.},

@article{Parida2022,
abstract = {A 11-day time series of optical, physical and biological observations were collected from the southern Bay of Bengal during the summer monsoon of 2016 as a part Bay of Bengal Boundary Layer Experiment (BoBBLE). These observations were used to estimate Radiative Heating Rate (RHR) and to further understand its dependence on biological and physical variables. Initially, the water column was characterized by an oligotrophic condition with weak surface chlorophyll (chl-a) concentration (<0.1 mg m-3). During this period, the sky was clear, mixed layer was shallow and RHR reached up to 0.14 °C hr-1. Subsequently, the mixed layer deepened (60–70 m) and the surface chl-a concentration increased to 0.4 mg m-3. However, the sky was relatively cloudy (cloud index = 32%) and the RHR reduced to 0.01 °C hr-1 owing to reduced solar incidence. The observations suggest that the combined effect of physical and biological factors determine the RHR in the water column. A one-dimensional light penetration model simulations showed that the biological heating of 10 W m-2 would generate additional heating of 0.008 °C hr-1 in the upper ocean indicating significant impact of elevated chl-a concentration. These improved understanding of biophysical interaction in the Bay of Bengal will help to improve our knowledge about the chl-a induced feedbacks on sea surface temperature.},

abstract = {This study examines the effect of surface current in the bulk formula for the wind stress, referred to as the relative wind (RW) effect, on the energetics of the geostrophic circulation and the upper ocean stratification in the Bay of Bengal (BoB) during the summer monsoon seasons. When the RW effect is taken into account in the high-resolution SCOAR (WRF-ROMS) regional coupled model simulation and compared to the run without such a consideration, the kinetic energy both in the mean (MKE) and eddy (EKE) is reduced by more than a factor of two. The most significant reduction in the kinetic energy is found along the path of the northward East India Coastal Current (EICC) and to the south of its separated latitude. The energetics calculations and spectral analysis reveal that this significant damping of EKE is primarily due to reduced eddy wind work principally at wavelengths close to the first baroclinic Rossby deformation radius, indicating the modulation of the wind work by geostrophic mesoscale eddy fields. Moreover, the mixed layer depth (MLD) is significantly shoaled south of the separated EICC latitude, the area dominated by anticyclonic eddy activity. The shallower mixed layer and enhanced stratification with the RW effect are attributed to doming of the isopycnals by the anomalous upward Ekman velocity, which itself is generated by the interaction of anticyclonic mesoscale surface current and the prevailing southwesterly monsoonal wind. Overall, the geostrophic circulation and upper ocean stratification along the EICC and south of its separated latitude exhibit the most significant dynamical response. This result implies that this southwestern part of the BoB is a hot spot for the momentum exchange between the surface circulation and the monsoonal winds, thus a potential area for focused field measurements for the ocean circulation energetics and air-sea interaction.},

abstract = {The monsoon reversal winds in different seasons and high influx of freshwater from various rivers make the Bay of Bengal (BoB) a unique region. Thus, the knowledge of the dynamics of the mixed layer over this region is very important to assess the climatic variation of the Indian subcontinent. A comprehensive study of the role of external forcing on the seasonal and interannual mixed layer depth (MLD) variability over the BoB is carried out for 36 years (1980-2015) using reanalysis products. A weak and strong seasonality of MLD is observed over the northern and the southern BoB (NBoB and SBoB) respectively. The partial correlation suggests that the net heat flux (Qnet) is the major contributor to the deepening of MLD over the NBoB, whereas the wind stress controls the deepening over the SBoB. The seasonal variability reveals the deepening of MLD during summer and winter monsoon and the shallowing during pre- and post-monsoon over the BoB. The relation of the interannual MLD variability and the different phases of the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) reveals that the negative phase of IOD is associated with deeper MLD over BoB while the positive phase of IOD depicts shallower MLD. In addition, the opposing characteristic of MLD is highly prominent during October-December. This is majorly contributed by variations related to the second downwelling Kelvin and associated Rossby waves over BoB for the opposing phases of the IOD years.},

abstract = {The thermal inversion (TI) is an interesting feature of the global ocean that plays a significant role in ocean-atmospheric process. This study addressed the spatial variability of the TI in the northern Bay of Bengal (NBoB) associated with mixed layer depth (MLD), isothermal layer depth (ILD), barrier layer thickness (BLT), and water mass formation in the winter season. Temperature, salinity, and density measurements were obtained via Conductivity, Temperature, Depth (CTD) casts from 12 different stations. The stations were divided into two regions: the north-western BoB (NW-BoB, 89.5°E: 90.5°E; 21.1°N to 21.6°N), and the north-eastern BoB (NE-BoB, 91°E to 92.1°E; 20.5°N to 21.2°N). Average profiles of the NW-BoB had deeper mixed layer (MLD of 10.30 m) and isothermal layer (ILD of 8.40 m) than profiles in the NE-BoB. The barrier layer in the NW-BoB was also thicker (2.79 m) than in the NE-BoB (1.05 m). One possible reason for these differences is the massive freshwater influx in the NW-BoB, as freshwater reduces salinity (27 PSU in the NW-BoB versus 35 PSU in the NE-BoB) and results in shallower MLD and ILD. Spatially organized TIs occurred in both the NE-BoB and NW-BoB during winter (January–February). Two distinct TI layers at 5 m and 28 m depth were visible in the NE-BoB to the formation of two water masses, the Bay of Bengal Low Salinity Water Mass and the Preparis Channel Water Mass. The NW-BoB featured only one TI layer at 8 m (with a inversion temperature of 0.58 °C), which was associated with the formation of one distinct water mass, the Bay of Bengal Intermediate Water Mass. Spatial variability of the TIs is a function of freshwater flux and surface cooling in the NBoB. More detailed investigation is needed to further understand the TIs and in the NBoB.},

This advection leads to the development of strong upper-ocean stratification (salinity stratification), which can have a significant impact on the evolution of SST and SSS by modifying mixing near the surface. In this study, we use a 1-dimensional (1-D) ocean mixing model (PWP) forced with in-situ air–sea fluxes from a surface mooring, along with estimates of horizontal surface freshwater and heat advection from a satellite ocean current product. We develop an ensemble of 1-D simulations by varying estimates of the advection used to force the model and analyze how the advection of temperature and salinity influences the evolution of SST and SSS. The use of an ensemble of solutions, rather than any single solution, compensates for uncertainty in our satellite estimates and significantly improves confidence in our results. Our results indicate that air–sea fluxes are not sufficient to properly simulate the evolution of SST in the northern Bay of Bengal, and that accounting for freshwater advection is required in order to reduce error in SST.},

abstract = {The present study investigates the impact of excess river runoff (eRR) and deficit river runoff (dRR) on the Bay of Bengal (BoB) upper ocean physics and circulation patterns using high resolution Modular Ocean Model version 5 (MOM5) simulations. The ocean model MOM5 was forced by 3-hourly surface fluxes and interannual river runoff from the Japanese 55-year Reanalysis (JRA-55). Sensitivity experiments are carried out with interannual and climatological river discharges from 1965 to 2016. Four positive river runoff anomaly years (1980, 1988, 1990, 2007) and four negative river runoff anomaly years (1979, 1986, 1992, 2009) during the satellite era, which are not influenced by the equatorial wind anomalies, are considered for the detailed analysis of eRR and dRR years. The study reveals that the distribution of salinity and the freshwater plume in eRR years differ significantly in the northern and western BoB from that of dRR years. The sea surface salinity difference is $\sim$2 psu in the northern BoB and the advection of freshwater by the southward East India Coastal Current (EICC) reaches the southern part of the BoB and enters the Arabian Sea in the eRR years. A strong cooling is observed in eRR years over the plume distributed area during post-monsoon and the excess freshwater amplifies the EICC as well. The large inflow of freshwater during eRR years is closely associated with a shallow mixed layer depth (MLD), formation of a thick barrier layer (BL), and strong circulation and temperature inversions, while the dRR years accumulate more heat compared to the eRR years in the upper 100 m of the plume area. This study, therefore, provides evidence for the impact of freshwater discharge on the BoB upper ocean processes. These may have a large impact on the local air-sea coupled processes and so representing accurate river discharge in climate models is crucial. It is also found that the EICC and the basin-wide cyclonic gyre advect the barrier layer along the Indian east coast into the southeastern Arabian Sea. This is one of the first studies to incorporate interannual runoff of all the major rivers flowing into the BoB in an ocean general circulation model for investigations of BoB processes.},

abstract = {The seasonal variations and driving mechanisms of the surface and subsurface chlorophyll-a concentrations in the Bay of Bengal are far from resolved, as only a few local, short-term studies have been performed. Hence, this study investigates a comprehensive basin-wide framework of the seasonal variations in the chlorophyll-a concentration, its dominant external forcing, and the internal dynamics of the Bay of Bengal. Multivariate empirical orthogonal function decomposition and heterogeneous correlation analyses are applied to numerous observational, reanalysis, and satellite datasets, including chlorophyll-a, nutrients, temperature, salinity, turbidity, and wind stress curl datasets collected from various sources, including the Copernicus Marine Environment Monitoring Service, World Ocean Atlas, and ERA-Interim. This study suggests that the chlorophyll-a concentrations at both the surface and the subsurface chlorophyll-a maximum (SCM) are higher during summer and early autumn than during the other seasons, especially along the coastal regions and western part of the Bay of Bengal. During summer and early autumn, riverine nutrient inputs, the intrusion of nutritious water from the Arabian Sea, and coastal upwelling are the three dominant drivers controlling the chlorophyll-a concentrations at both the surface and the SCM. The positive wind stress curl-induced uplift of the thermocline increases the nutrient supply and thus significantly enhances the chlorophyll-a concentration at the SCM along the entire western side of the bay during the second half of the year. During spring, the deep euphotic depth plays a vital role in controlling the concentration and depth of the SCM. The depth of the 26 °C isotherm can be used as a proxy of the depth of the SCM. This study provides an improved understanding of the high chlorophyll-a concentrations and their drivers in five potential zones within the Bay of Bengal, which will help to identify the rich marine ecosystems therein.},

@article{Jain2021,
abstract = {Earlier studies suggest that the mixed-layer (ML) temperature or sea surface temperature (SST) of the Bay of Bengal during the summer monsoon is determined primarily by air–sea fluxes. We use an oceanic general circulation model (OGCM) to show that oceanic processes also play a significant role. Model heat-budget computations show that horizontal and vertical advection, constituting the direct role of dynamics, contribute significantly to the SST tendency in the western bay. The eastern limit of this direct-role regime is determined by downwelling Rossby waves, which are forced largely from the equatorial Indian Ocean, but are modified by alongshore winds at the eastern boundary and Ekman pumping along their westward path across the bay. The current and, as a result, advection weaken behind the Rossby waves. To the east of the Rossby wavefront, the thermocline is deep, permitting a deeper ML, but the actual ML depth (MLD) depends on the wind speed, with salinity also playing a role in the northern bay. Yet, there is negligible change in the SST even when MLD changes significantly because the deep thermocline decouples the changes in MLD and SST. In contrast, the shallower thermocline in the western bay limits the potential MLD, leading to larger changes in SST. The upwelling (downwelling) Rossby wave essentially conditions the upper ocean by decreasing (increasing) the potential depth of the mixed layer. SST variation weakens only when the thermocline deepens during downwelling events, which occur later in the western bay because Rossby waves propagate westward. The significant, but subtle, role of the Rossby waves in decoupling the changes in MLD and SST via downwelling is indirect, unlike the direct role of advection estimated in a standard heat-budget computation, and has been largely ignored in earlier studies.},

abstract = {The sensitivity of the Bay of Bengal (BoB) upper ocean circulation and thermohaline structure to varying wind strengths and river salinity conditions is investigated using a set of long-term mesoscale simulations. The Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS) simulations differ in their forcing fields for winds (strong vs. weak) and in their representations of river input salinity conditions (seasonally varying estuarine salinity vs. zero salinity). The sensitivities are analyzed in terms of the responses of the surface circulation, thermohaline structure, freshwater plume dispersion, and the coastal upwelling along the western boundary. All the simulations reproduce the main broad-scale features of the Bay, while their magnitudes and variabilities depend on the forcing conditions. The impact of stronger wind is felt at greater depths for temperature than for salinity throughout the domain; however, the impact is realized with vertical distributions that are different in the northern than in the southern Bay. As expected, the stronger wind-induced enhanced mixing lowers (enhances) the upper ocean temperature (salinity) by 0.2 °C (0.3 psu), and weakens the near-surface stratification. Moreover, stronger wind enhances eddy activity, strengthens the springtime Western Boundary Current (WBC) and enhances coastal upwelling during spring and summer along the east coast of India. The fresher river input reduces the surface salinity and hence enhances the spreading and intensity of the freshwater plume, stratification, and barrier layer thickness. The lower salinity simulation leads to an eddy-dominant springtime WBC, and enhances the freshness, strength, and southward extent of the autumn East India Coastal Current (EICC). The stronger wind simulations appear to prevent the spreading of the freshwater plume during the summer monsoon due to enhanced mixing. Fresher river input reduces the overall surface salinity by $\sim$0.4 psu; however, it significantly underestimates the salinity near the river mouths, whereas the estuarine salinity river input simulations are closer to reality. These results highlight the importance of river input salinity and realistic strong winds in reducing model biases of high-resolution simulations for the Bay of Bengal.},

@article{Shroyer2020,
abstract = {The Bay of Bengal is forced by the South Asian monsoon and associated seasonally reversing winds and freshwater fluxes. Here, we summarize a high-resolution, basin-wide survey of the Bay of Bengal conducted during the 2013 northeast (winter) monsoon. The observed mixed layer waters were sourced from the eastern Bay; and, generally, the upper ocean temperature-salinity properties followed regional trends as determined by Argo. Intense lateral mixed layer gradients were seen throughout the Bay. The majority of the observed fronts were salinity-controlled with compensating temperature gradients. Similarly, salinity was typically the primary control on the vertical density stratification near the mixed layer depth. In contrast to the shallow, sharp halocline, temperature stratification was enhanced over a larger depth range with the base of the near-surface isothermal layer often located beneath the mixed layer, indicating the presence of a barrier layer. Finescale layers in vertical temperature and salinity stratification were traced over distances greater than 100 km in the horizontal. Within a $\sim$week-long period, we observed a significant reduction in the intensity of gradients (both lateral and vertical) as well as a shift in the relative importance of salinity in setting the observed gradients. By the end of the 17-day cruise when the ship was in the southern Bay of Bengal, temperature was an equal or dominant contributor to lateral and vertical gradients. Stratification and mixed layer fronts evolved over a relatively short time scale, likely in response to strong atmospheric forcing either associated with a tropical cyclone, sustained northeast monsoon conditions, or a combination of the two. Resolution of the observed lateral gradients requires sampling at lateral scales O(1km) or smaller, suggestive of the importance of the submesoscale.},

abstract = {The mixed layer depth is directly affected by natural processes in the atmosphere. Mixed layer depth in the Andaman Sea was analyzed based on salinity data from the 3-dimensional model from the Copernicus Marine Environment Monitoring Service. Seasonal signals are formed to identify the number of mixed layer depth seasons in a year. Wind, precipitation, temperature, and salinity performance analysis were performed using a monthly average value for 26 years. Based on the results, mixed layer depth differences in the Andaman Sea are influenced by wind and precipitation. The wind has a direct impact on mixed layer depth. The wind strength affects simultaneously as mixed layer depth conditions. Precipitation shows an indirect impact on mixed layer depth. Precipitation takes time to accumulate effect to change the state of mixed layer depth. The time required for precipitation is two months before the change in the mixed layer depth occurs. The mixed layer depth has two seasons annually, and the more significant season occurs in April as the lowest point and July as the deepest point. In the other season, October has a moderately shallow depth, and January has a moderately deep depth. The average differences in temperature and salinity in the surface layer and the mixed layer were 0.1266 °C and 0.2477 practical salinity units.},

@article{Kumar2019,
abstract = {Widespread SST cooling (1.5–2 °C) of the Bay of Bengal occurred in response to cyclone Roanu 2016, a weak, pre-monsoon storm. We investigate this using data from a Lagrangian float, measuring temperature, salinity and velocity profiles in the upper 80 m, supplemented by 3 Argo floats. At the Lagrangian float, cooling was primarily due to mixing of the warm (32 °C), fresh cap formed during the previous months of light winds and clear skies, accounting for about half of the cooling. Air-sea heat fluxes played a secondary role, accounting for about a quarter of the cooling. The depth of mixing was diagnosed by two measures: a traditional mixed layer depth and a “mixing depth” defined as the deepest depth unstable to shear instability. The mixing depth was roughly twice ($\sim$65 m) the mixed layer depth ($\sim$35 m), illustrating the importance of the “transition layer” between them. The mixed layer restratified into 2 layers within a day after the end of the storm with near-inertial frequency waves gented by the storm increasing the diapycnal mixing rates at the depth of the transition layer to about 10−4 m2s−1. A popular upper ocean mixing model (PWP) driven by heat, moisture and momentum fluxes from reanalysis products (ERA-5 and CCMP) reproduced the maximum mixed layer depth to within a meter; maximum mixing depth was underpredicted by 10 m. These results were insensitive to uncertainties in the air-sea forcing. The change in SST was underestimated by 0.7 °C and the model predicts few of the observed variations in mixed layer salinity. Some of these errors are due to uncertainties in air-sea fluxes, but lateral processes must also play a role, both during the storm and during the subsequent restratification. Data from the Argo floats, although much less detailed, show similar patterns with better simulations of mixed layer depth than of temperature and salinity evolution. Large-scale models generally underestimate the stratification of the upper 50 m of the Bay of Bengal leading to biases in modeling the important air-sea interactions that occur. These results suggest that although these errors may partially be due to errors in modelled vertical mixing rates, errors in modeling horizontal variability and its interaction with vertical mixing are also likely to be important.},

@article{Narvekar2006,
abstract = {Hydrographic data from National Oceanographic Data Center (NODC) and Responsible National Oceanographic Data Centre (RNODC) were used to study the seasonal variability of the mixed layer in the central Bay of Bengal (8-20°N and 87-91°E), while meteorological data from Comprehensive Ocean Atmosphere Data Set (COADS) were used to explore atmospheric forcing responsible for the variability. The observed changes in the mixed-layer depth (MLD) clearly demarcated a distinct north-south regime with 15°N as the limiting latitude. North of this latitude MLD remained shallow (∼20 m) for most of the year without showing any appreciable seasonality. Lack of seasonality suggests that the low-salinity water, which is perennially present in the northern Bay, controls the stability and MLD. The observed winter freshening is driven by the winter rainfall and associated river discharge, which is advected offshore under the prevailing circulation. The resulting stratification was so strong that even a 4 °C cooling in sea-surface temperature (SST) during winter was unable to initiate convective mixing. In contrast, the southern region showed a strong semi-annual variability with deep MLD during summer and winter and a shallow MLD during spring and fall intermonsoons. The shallow MLD in spring and fall results from primary and secondary heating associated with increased incoming solar radiation and lighter winds during this period. The deep mixed layer during summer results from two processes: the increased wind forcing and the intrusion of high-salinity waters of Arabian Sea origin. The high winds associated with summer monsoon initiate greater wind-driven mixing, while the intrusion of high-salinity waters erodes the halocline and weakens the upper-layer stratification of the water column and aids in vertical mixing. The deep MLD in the south during winter was driven by wind-mixing, when the upper water column was comparatively less stable. The deep MLD between 15 and 17°N during March-May cannot be explained in the context of local atmospheric forcing. We show that this is associated with the propagation of Rossby waves from the eastern Bay. We also show that the nitrate and chlorophyll distribution in the upper ocean during spring intermonsoon is strongly coupled to the MLD, whereas during summer river runoff and cold-core eddies appear to play a major role in regulating the nutrients and chlorophyll. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The effects of horizontal discretization on linear baroclinic and symmetric instabilities are investigated by analyzing the behavior of the hydrostatic Eady problem in ocean models on the B and C grids. On the C grid a spurious baroclinic instability appears at small wavelengths. This instability does not disappear as the grid scale decreases; instead, it simply moves to smaller horizontal scales. The peak growth rate of the spurious instability is independent of the grid scale as the latter decreases. It is equal to cf/Ri where Ri is the balanced Richardson number, f is the Coriolis parameter, and c is a nondimensional constant that depends on the Richardson number. As the Richardson number increases c increases towards an upper bound of approximately 1/2; for large Richardson numbers the spurious instability is faster than the Eady instability. To suppress the spurious instability it is recommended to use fourth-order centered tracer advection along with biharmonic viscosity and diffusion with coefficients ($\Delta$x)4f/(32Ri) or larger where $\Delta$x is the grid scale. On the B grid, the growth rates of baroclinic and symmetric instabilities are too small, and converge upwards towards the correct values as the grid scale decreases; no spurious instabilities are observed. In B grid models at eddy-permitting resolution, the reduced growth rate of baroclinic instability may contribute to partially-resolved eddies being too weak. On the C grid the growth rate of symmetric instability is better (larger) than on the B grid, and converges upwards towards the correct value as the grid scale decreases.},

abstract = {Although the performance of the high-resolution global ocean forecasting system, which is based on First Institute of Oceanography surface wave-tide-circulation coupled ocean model (FIO-COM) has been demonstrated to have reasonable accuracy in global context, especially in tropical oceans and some special cases, the assessment needs to be extended in different parts of the global oceans. As such, given the significance of a regional Ocean Forecasting System (OFS) in the world's prominent freshwater dominated basin, the northern Bay of Bengal, a groundwork is crucial for the modeling community. Thus, performance of FIO-COM analysis and forecasting results is assessed by utilizing available moored buoy, satellite, and reanalysis datasets. The present study compares the thermohaline structure related variables (e.g., temperature, salinity) from FIO-COM with aforementioned datasets on a seasonal and daily basis. We focused on evaluating the FIO-COM outputs during a very severe cyclonic storm named Titli that formed in October, 2018. The root-mean-square errors (RMSEs) for sea surface temperature (SST) ranges from 0.47 to 0.71 °C, and for sea surface salinity from 0.62 to 0.83 psu; while vertical profile RMSE ranges from 0.27 to 1.0 °C for temperature, and 0.22 to 0.56 psu for salinity between FIO-COM products and observations. Daily variations in different thermohaline structure related variables at two RAMA positions are also well captured by the FIO-COM outputs. Both model and satellite data show pronounced SST cooling (approximately 2.0–2.5 °C) and increased sea surface salinity ($\sim$ 1 psu) on the right side of the cyclone track. High SST, TCHP and deep isothermal layer depth were the main oceanic triggering forces to intensify the cyclone Titli.},

abstract = {Reconstruction projects after the Indian Ocean Tsunami of December 26, 2004 were typically contracted out to implementing partners or government agencies. One of the few projects directly implemented by the Body of Rehabilitation and Reconstruction (BRR) was funded by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to help reestablish fisheries. During the course of the project, 151 GPS-enabled depth sounders with data-logging devices were installed on various types of artisanal fishing boats engaged in the different types of fishing strategies in Aceh such as purse-seine, drop-line, long-line, and gill net fishing. These devices were configured to automatically record time, position, speed, water depth, and sea surface temperature (SST) every time the boat moved 30 m. This study examines the relationship between the sea surface temperature (SST) and the net deployment (ND) of traditional purse seine fishers. The data consists of 922 data sets (6,170,648 data points) collected from 45 purse seine boats between June 2007 and May 2009. Among the data, 1,619 data points indicated the total number of ND; the nets were deployed only when schools of fish were actually sighted. The results indicate that the most frequent SST for ND is 28–28.5°C±0.1365°C with a mean standard error of 0.0117% in a 95% confidence interval. This study has demonstrated that the data gathered from the fishermen (community-based approach) has near-real-time character and, consequently, is an important source for the monitoring and managing of the local fish stocks.},

abstract = {The research was conducted by considering the values of temperature, mixed layer depth (MLD) as a result of the analysis, and sea-level winds in the waters of North Aceh. MLD was analyzed from the results of the three-dimensional Copernicus marine environment monitoring service (CMEMS) model, which has been validated with sea surface temperature (SST) data from the monthly Aqua MODIS. The results show that SST CMEMS is relatively the same as SST Aqua MODIS with variations up to 2°C. The verification of SST CMEMS data for February, April, August and October showed quite good results with a correlation value of r = 0.8523. Analysis in February, August, and October shows MLD is deepest. MLD in Aceh's northern waters is 68-91 meters, and Sabang and Krueng Raya waters are 68-79 meters. However, MLD is at its most shallow in April. The waters of North Aceh is 49 meters, Sabang waters is 40 meters, and Krueng Raya is 9 meters. In February, the wind speed occurs in the northeast wind direction with a speed of 3.2 m/s. April and October occur in the direction of the transitional monsoon. The wind speed in April is 2.2 m/s, and October is 2.9 m/s. The southwest wind direction is 4.1 m/s in October. From these results, the influence of the monsoon wind is enormous in the waters of northern Aceh.},

@article{Saji2003,
abstract = {A study of the detailed spatiotemporal characteristics of the Indian Ocean dipole (IOD) mode in SST and surface winds using available observations from 1958 till 1997 is reported. The analysis is used to address several of the controversial issues regarding the IOD. One key finding of this study is that interdecadal fluctuations contribute strongly to tropical Indian Ocean (TIO) SST variability; in SST anomalies (SSTA) interdecadal variance is as strong as interannual variance. Over both the western and eastern TIO, an accelerated warming of SST after the mid-1970s is apparent. The lack of anticorrelation between western and eastern TIO SSTA occurs only in this latter half of the analysis period. In order to examine the hypothesis that the IOD is a part of ENSO evolution in the TIO, the temporal characteristics of IOD indices have been compared with Nino-3. On the basis of several quantitative comparisons that include wavelet and cross-wavelet analysis, several important differences between the two phenomena are reported. These differences are highlighted to argue that the IOD is not a part of ENSO evolution in the TIO. On the other hand, a striking similarity is found in the temporal structure of atmospheric and oceanic variability within the TIO that is suggestive of IOD arising from inherent coupled air-sea interactions in the TIO. ENSO events that do not co-occur with IOD have been isolated and their impacts on TIO SSTA and winds described. Similarly, the characteristics of IOD events that occur independently of ENSO are described. Based on the characteristics of these two groups a hypothesis is suggested through which both phenomena may interact. It is noted that ENSO events co-occurring with IOD events are much stronger compared to non-co-occurring events. On the other hand, IOD events that are independent of ENSO as well as those that co-occur with it appear to have the same strength.},

abstract = {This work presents an open-source tool to predict natural system responses by transforming the frequency spectrum of predictor variables to create a response that better resembles observations. The R package, namely WAvelet System Prediction (WASP), is based on a discrete wavelet transform (DWT)-based variance transformation method. We further introduce the maximal overlap DWT (MODWT)-based variance transformation which allows the method to be used in forecasting applications. We also develop the method to include an unbiased estimator that mitigates the well-known issue of edge effects in wavelet transforms. The predictive model in the method is a k-nearest neighbor (knn) approach. The main functionalities of the software include: (1) transforming the system predictors, (2) identifying significant predictors corresponding to the response, (3) predicting target response using the knn. Results of predicting sustained drought anomalies across Australia show clear improvements in predictive skill compared to the use of untransformed predictors.},

abstract = {It is important and highly desirable to identify and forecast the strength of dominant modes of Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) events. A daily time series of dipole mode index (DMI) is derived from remotely sensed satellite SST observations. The empirical mode decomposition (EMD) technique is applied on this time series to identify intrinsic mode functions of observed IOD index. The spatial maps of the dominant IOD modes exhibit observed dipolar structure. For each dominant IOD mode, a forecasting rule is given to predict the peak SST anomalies (strength) of the positive and negative IOD regimes. The feasibility of using growth rate of SST anomalies in one regime for the prediction of peak SST anomalies in subsequent regime is also explored in an effort to develop an extended-range forecast model. It is shown that the peak SST anomalies in a regime corresponding to the most dominant mode of the IOD (with a time scale of 340-619 days) may be predicted with a lead-time of nearly 9-10 months. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

@article{Tomita2019,
abstract = {Accurate observational estimation of the ocean surface heat, momentum, and freshwater fluxes is crucial for studies of the global climate system. Estimating surface flux using satellite remote sensing techniques is one possible answer to this challenge. In this paper, we introduce J-OFURO3, a third-generation data set developed by the Japanese Ocean Flux Data Sets with Use of Remote-Sensing Observations (J-OFURO) research project, which represents a significant improvement from older data sets as the result of research and development conducted from several perspectives. J-OFURO3 offers data sets for surface heat, momentum, freshwater fluxes, and related parameters over the global oceans (except regions of sea ice) from 1988 to 2013. The surface flux data, based on a 0.25° grid system, have a higher spatial resolution and are more accurate than the previous efforts. This has been achieved through the adopting of the state-of-the-art algorithms that estimate the near-surface air specific humidity and the improvement of techniques using observations from multi-satellite sensors. Comparisons with in situ observations using a systematic system developed along with the J-OFURO3 data set confirmed these improvements in accuracy, as did comparisons with other data sets. J-OFURO3 data are of good quality, facilitating a clearer understanding of more fine-scale ocean–atmosphere features (such as ocean fronts, mesoscale eddies, and geographic features) and their effects on surface fluxes. The information contained in this long-term (26 year) data set is demonstrably beneficial to understanding climate change and its relationship to oceans and the atmosphere.},

@article{Kalnay1996,
abstract = {The NCEP and NCAR are cooperating in a project (denoted "reanalysis") to produce a 40-year record of global analyses of atmospheric fields in support of the needs of the research and climate monitoring communities. This effort involves the recovery of land surface, ship, rawinsonde, pibal, aircraft, satellite, and other data; quality controlling and assimilating these data with a data assimilation system that is kept unchanged over the reanalysis period 1957-96. This eliminates perceived climate jumps associated with changes in the data assimilation system. The NCEP/NCAR 40-yr reanalysis uses a frozen state-of-the-art global data assimilation system and a database as complete as possible. The data assimilation and the model used are identical to the global system implemented operationally at the NCEP on 11 January 1995, except that the horizontal resolution is T62 (about 210 km). The database has been enhanced with many sources of observations not available in real time for operations, provided by different countries and organizations. The system has been designed with advanced quality control and monitoring components, and can produce 1 mon of reanalysis per day on a Cray YMP/8 supercomputer. Different types of output archives are being created to satisfy different user needs, including a "quick look" CD-ROM (one per year) with six tropospheric and stratospheric fields available twice daily, as well as surface, top-of-the-atmosphere, and isentropic fields. Reanalysis information and selected output is also available on-line via the Internet (http//:nic.fb4.noaa.gov:8000). A special CD-ROM, containing 13 years of selected observed, daily, monthly, and climatological data from the NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis, is included with this issue. Output variables are classified into four classes, depending on the degree to which they are influenced by the observations and/or the model. For example, "C" variables (such as precipitation and surface fluxes) are completely determined by the model during the data assimilation and should be used with caution. Nevertheless, a comparison of these variables with observations and with several climatologies shows that they generally contain considerable useful information. Eight-day forecasts, produced every 5 days, should be useful for predictability studies and for monitoring the quality of the observing systems. The 40 years of reanalysis (1957-96) should be completed in early 1997. A continuation into the future through an identical Climate Data Assimilation System will allow researchers to reliably compare recent anomalies with those in earlier decades. Since changes in the observing systems will inevitably produce perceived changes in the climate, parallel reanalyses (at least 1 year long) will be generated for the periods immediately after the introduction of new observing systems, such as new types of satellite data. NCEP plans currently call for an updated reanalysis using a state-of-the-art system every five years or so. The successive reanalyses will be greatly facilitated by the generation of the comprehensive database in the present reanalysis.},

@article{Pan2018,
abstract = {This study advances the previous understanding of the role of climate variability on Indonesian fire activity, by considering (i) the presence of different types of El Nino and (ii) the interaction between El Nino and the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD). We classify 12 El Nino events during 1979–2016 into Eastern Pacific (EP) and Central Pacific (CP) types (four and eight El Nino events, respectively) and analyze observational data of sea surface temperature, precipitation, drought code, biomass burning carbon emission, visibility, and aerosol optical depth accordingly. We find that more intense and prolonged Indonesian drought and fires occur in the EP type, during which the emitted carbon amounts almost double those in the CP type. By further separating the CP type El Nino according to the phase of the IOD, that is, positive and negative, we show that fire seasons with less burning intensity and shorter duration are predominantly associated with weakly positive or even negative phase of the IOD phenomena. Moreover, fire intensity exhibits geographic diversity: fires are always more intensive in southern Kalimantan than in southern Sumatra in all El Nino events, although it is less dry in the former region. The outcome of this study can be applied to drought early warning, fire management, and air quality forecast in Indonesia and adjacent areas by identifying the type of El Nino and the phase of the IOD in advance.},

Anomalous chlorophyll blooms were triggered by two cold-core eddies, along the periphery of the coastal upwelling zone. Observational evidence suggest that the eddy formation and propagation can be attributed to the local wind forcing and the remote effects originating around Sri Lanka and the southern tip of India (STI) during the extreme negative Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) of 2016. The eddy-induced anomalous shoaling of thermocline indicates strong upwelling of subsurface nutrients and chlorophyll and enhanced light availability for phytoplankton growth favoring the observed biological response.

abstract = {Changes in the environmental condition associated with climatic events could potentially influence the PSC dynamics of the regional marine ecosystem. The Indian Ocean dipole (IOD) is one of the critical ocean–atmosphere interactions that affects the climate of the Arabian Sea, and it could be a potential factor influencing the regional PSC distribution. However, the relationship between PSC and IOD remains unclear and less explored. In this study, using the in-situ database acquired from the Arabian Sea, we reparametrized the three−component abundance−based phytoplankton size class model and applied it to reconstructed satellite−derived chlorophyll−a concentration to extract the fractional contribution of phytoplankton size classes to chlorophyll−a concentration. Further, we investigated the influence of IOD on the changes in the biological–physical properties in the Arabian Sea. The results showed that the biological–physical processes in the Arabian Sea are interlinked and the changes in the IOD mode control the physical variables like sea surface temperature (SST), sea surface height (SSH), and mixed layer depth (MLD), which influence the specific PSC abundance. Unprecedented changes in the PSC distribution and physical properties were observed during the extreme positive and negative IOD events, which clearly indicated the potential role of IOD in altering the PSC distribution in the Arabian Sea. This study highlights the impact of extreme climate events on PSC distribution and the need for a better understanding of the associated physical–biological–climate interactions.},

@article{Sattar2019,
abstract = {Climatologically, tropical cyclone (TC) activity in the North Indian Ocean (NIO) is asymmetric between the Arabian Sea (AS) and Bay of Bengal (BoB) basin. For the 172 TCs formed over NIO during 1983–2015, only 56 formed over AS and the rest (116) over BoB. During the period, AS was very active in a few years (but with quiet BoB season), and the opposite occurred in some others. It is found that this contrast occurred mostly during the post-monsoon season of October–December. The meteorological and climate factors that accounted for these contrasting AS and BoB TC seasons are analysed. While climate variability such as the El Nino Southern Oscillation and Indian Ocean Dipole have known influences to NIO TC activity, results reveal that no single climate mode can well explain the TC development concentrating on AS or BoB only. Instead, it is found that variability of the northeast monsoon is an important factor responsible for the difference between the two basins. Excess moisture is available over the AS due to anomalous low-level flow from the equatorial IO in the years in which there are more TCs in that basin, and dryer condition is over the BoB. In these years, there is likely excess northeast monsoon rainfall. The relationship is opposite between post-monsoon BoB TC activity and the northeast monsoon. Nevertheless, the anomalous flow during active AS TC seasons is similar to that occurs during positive Indian Ocean Dipole, and thus this climate variability may be responsible for redistributing the moisture content in the NIO.},

abstract = {For the tropical Pacific and Atlantic oceans, internal modes of variability that lead to climatic oscillations have been recognized1,2, but in the Indian Ocean region a similar ocean–atmosphere interaction causing interannual climate variability has not yet been found3. Here we report an analysis of observational data over the past 40 years, showing a dipole mode in the Indian Ocean: a pattern of internal variability with anomalously low sea surface temperatures off Sumatra and high sea surface temperatures in the western Indian Ocean, with accompanying wind and precipitation anomalies. The spatio-temporal links between sea surface temperatures and winds reveal a strong coupling through the precipitation field and ocean dynamics. This air–sea interaction process is unique and inherent in the Indian Ocean, and is shown to be independent of the El Nino/Southern Oscillation. The discovery of this dipole mode that accounts for about 12% of the sea surface temperature variability in the Indian Ocean—and, in its active years, also causes severe rainfall in eastern Africa and droughts in Indonesia—brightens the prospects for a long-term forecast of rainfall anomalies in the affected countries.},

Over the Bay of Bengal (BOB) and South China Sea (SCS), an associated low-level anomalous anticyclone strengthens the southwesterlies during boreal fall (September, October and November, SON), when a pIOD matures. The increased moisture flux gives rise to the anomalously high rainfall over southern China. During its developing phase (boreal summer, June, July and August, JJA), the influence of a pIOD event on the contemporaneous rainfall over southern China is weak, but a JJA pIOD index is highly correlated with fall rainfall. Therefore, this index can serve as a potential predictor for variations of boreal fall rainfall over southern China.},

abstract = {Province-wide data on flood-destroyed and flood-affected crop areas across China covering a period of 1960-2013 were analyzed in this study for investigating their relations with climate indices, such as ENSO, NAO, IOD, PDO and AMO. Results indicated that: (1) agricultural flooding in northeast and south China tended to enhance under the influence of warm PDO and warm IOD events of the previous years. However, agricultural flooding in southwest China tended to decrease as a result of warm ENSO events of the previous years. Agricultural floods in coastal regions of southeast China were influenced by more than one climate index; (2) Agricultural floods of different time scales were subject to different degrees of correlations with climate indices. Remarkably, climate indices that were significantly correlated with agricultural floods were usually temporally enhancing. Relations between ENSO and agricultural floods across China were statistically strong with good persistency. Thus, ENSO can be taken as a suitable predictor for flood-affected and flood-destroyed crop areas across China. However, AMO cannot be taken as the predictor for flood-affected and flood-destroyed crop areas in China; (3) The combined influence of climate indices on flood-affected and flood-destroyed crop areas across China did not have a firm spatiotemporal pattern. However, specific groups of climate indices can have definitive impacts on flood-affected and flood-destroyed crop areas over specific regions. Findings of this study can help predict flood-affected and flood-destroyed crop areas across provinces of China, and hence plan and manage agricultural activities in China.},

abstract = {Variations in the abundance and distribution of pelagic tuna populations have been associated with large-scale climate indices such as the Southern Oscillation Index in the Pacific Ocean and the North Atlantic Oscillation in the Atlantic Ocean. Similarly to the Pacific and Atlantic, variability in the distribution and catch rates of tuna species have also been observed in association with the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD), a basin-scale pattern of sea surface and subsurface temperatures that affect climate in the Indian Ocean. The environmental processes associated with the IOD that drive variability in tuna populations, however, are largely unexplored. To better understand these processes, we investigated longline catch rates of yellowfin tuna and their distributions in the western Indian Ocean in relation to IOD events, sea surface water temperatures (SST) and estimates of net primary productivity (NPP). Catch per unit effort (CPUE) was observed to be negatively correlated to the IOD with a periodicity centred around 4 years. During positive IOD events, SSTs were relatively higher, NPP was lower, CPUE decreased and catch distributions were restricted to the northern and western margins of the western Indian Ocean. During negative IOD events, lower SSTs and higher NPP were associated with increasing CPUE, particularly in the Arabian Sea and seas surrounding Madagascar, and catches expanded into central regions of the western Indian Ocean. These findings provide preliminary insights into some of the key environmental features driving the distribution of yellowfin tuna in the western Indian Ocean and associated variability in fisheries catches. {\textcopyright} 2012 The Author(s).},

In part of SCS, the pattern is relatively the same as in MS; that is, the currents during January are stronger than those during July.

abstract = {Background and Objectives: El Nino - Southern Oscillation is known to affect the marine and terrestrial environment in Southeast Asia, Australia, northern South America, and southern Africa. There has been much research showing that the effects of El Nino - Southern Oscillation are extensive. In this study, a simulation of an El Nino event is carried out, which is ideal in the vertical layer of the Pacific Ocean (0-250 meters). The fast Fourier transform is used to process the vertical modeling data so that the results can accurately represent El Nino. Methods: A non-hydrostatic 3-dimensional numerical model is used in this research. To separate the signal produced and obtain the quantitative difference of each sea layer, the simulation results are analyzed using the fast Fourier transform. Winds blow from the west to the east of the area in perfect El Nino weather, with a reasonably high wind zone near the equator (forming a cosine). Open fields can be found on the north and south sides, while closed fields can be found on the west and east sides. Density is uniform up to a depth of 100 meters, then uniformly increases by 1 kilogram per cubic meter from 100 to 250 meters. Findings: The results of the model simulation show that one month later (on the 37th day), the current from the west has approached the domain's east side, forming a complete coastal Kelvin wave. The shape of coastal Kelvin waves in the eastern area follows a trend that is similar to the OSCAR Sea Surface Velocity plot data obtained from ERDDAP in the Pacific Ocean in October 2015. In this period, the density at a depth of 0-100 meters is the same, while the density at the depth layer underneath is different. Conclusion: Strong winds could mix water masses up to a depth of 100 meters, implying that during an ideal El Nino, the stratification of the water column is influenced by strong winds. The eastern domain has the highest sea level amplitude, resulting in perfect mixing up to a depth of 100 m, while wind effect is negligible in the lower layers. The first layer (0-50 m) and the second layer (50-100 m) have the same density and occur along the equator, according to FFT. The density is different and much greater in the third layer (100-150 m).},

abstract = {For the tropical Pacific and Atlantic oceans, internal modes of variability that lead to climatic oscillations have been recognized1,2, but in the Indian Ocean region a similar ocean–atmosphere interaction causing interannual climate variability has not yet been found3. Here we report an analysis of observational data over the past 40 years, showing a dipole mode in the Indian Ocean: a pattern of internal variability with anomalously low sea surface temperatures off Sumatra and high sea surface temperatures in the western Indian Ocean, with accompanying wind and precipitation anomalies. The spatio-temporal links between sea surface temperatures and winds reveal a strong coupling through the precipitation field and ocean dynamics. This air–sea interaction process is unique and inherent in the Indian Ocean, and is shown to be independent of the El Nino/Southern Oscillation. The discovery of this dipole mode that accounts for about 12% of the sea surface temperature variability in the Indian Ocean—and, in its active years, also causes severe rainfall in eastern Africa and droughts in Indonesia—brightens the prospects for a long-term forecast of rainfall anomalies in the affected countries.},

abstract = {Based on 12 years (2007–2018) of salinity data from the Array for Real-Time Geostrophic Oceanography (Argo) dataset, we found significant positive salinity anomalies in the upper layer of the central tropical Indian Ocean from autumn 2010 to spring 2011 and from autumn 2016 to spring 2017. We used wind, precipitation, outgoing longwave radiation and ocean current data from satellites and reanalysis datasets to analyze the atmospheric conditions, ocean dynamic processes and salinity budget associated with these high salinity events. Our results suggest that surface buoyancy fluxes are not the dominant factor affecting the positive salinity anomalies and that ocean dynamic processes have a more important role. Under the influence of the La Nina events and strong negative Indian Ocean dipole in 2010 and 2016, positive salinity anomalies appeared in the eastern Indian Ocean at the end of 2010 and 2016 as a result of strong westerlies and positive zonal currents. However, because the La Nina event in 2010 was stronger than that in 2016, the salinity anomalies in 2010 were also stronger and the decrease in the following year was both stronger and lasted longer, meaning that the salinity anomalies weakened only gradually. The maximum value of the salinity anomalies in 2011 therefore appeared in January, whereas in 2017 the salinity anomalies first decreased and then increased, with the largest anomalies in March. Salinity budget analyses showed that ocean advection was the main factor leading to the variations in the salinity anomaly during these two periods and that the changes in the zonal velocity in the zonal advection anomalies had the greatest impact. Zonal advection was positive and strongest at the end of 2010 and negative in early 2011, but weakly positive at the end of 2016. In early 2017, the zonal advection was first negative, then became positive and strengthened in spring, so the salinity anomalies in spring 2017 were higher than those in 2011. The freshwater flux had a small, negative effect on the positive salinity anomalies for these two events. The mutual effects of the horizontal advection and the freshwater flux led to high salinity anomalies. The high salinity anomalies reflect the response of the upper ocean to climate events and may influence regional air–sea interactions and large-scale processes.},

abstract = {This study uses two reanalysis datasets and ocean model experiments to examine the dynamics of the interannual variability of the equatorial currents in the Indian Ocean, and to quantify the effects of the El Nino–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) climate modes on the currents. Strong interannual variability of the equatorial currents mainly occurs in the upper-central basin (UCB) where the Wyrtki jets are located, and in the subsurface-eastern basin (SEB) where the equatorial undercurrent is located. Equatorial waves directly forced by equatorial winds dominate the interannual current anomalies in both the UCB and the SEB, and the reflected waves have a secondary role. The reflected waves tend to weaken the current anomalies in the UCB but intensify the currents in the SEB. In general, ENSO and the IOD have a comparable effect on the interannual current anomalies in the SEB, but the IOD has a larger role than ENSO in the UCB. In some years, either ENSO or the IOD may play a dominant role. Composite analysis suggests that the interannual current anomalies occur about two months prior to the peaks the climate modes. As ENSO and the IOD have apparent seasonality, the current anomalies mainly occur during August to October for pure IOD years, and during October to December for pure ENSO years. The co-occurrence of ENSO and the IOD enhances their respective impact, resulting in the surface current anomalies lasting from July to December and the subsurface current anomalies from July to March of the following year.},

abstract = {In this study, on the basis of the results of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Ocean Reanalysis System 4, the response of equatorial ocean currents and their roles during the peak phase of the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) are comprehensively explored. During the IOD peak season, a series of ocean responses emerge. First, significant meridional divergence in the surface layer and convergence in the subsurface layer are found in the equatorial region. The equatorial easterly winds and off-equatorial wind curl anomalies are found to be responsible for the divergence at 55°–80°E and the convergence at 70°–90°E. Second, the meridional divergence and convergence are found to favor a weakened Wyrtki jet (WJ) in the surface layer and an enhanced Equatorial Undercurrent (EUC) in the subsurface layer, respectively. Therefore, these ocean responses provide ocean positive feedback that sustains the IOD peak as the weakened WJ and enhanced EUC help maintain the zonal temperature gradient. Additionally, heat budget analyses indicate that the weakened WJ favors sea surface temperature anomaly warming in the western Indian Ocean, whereas the enhanced EUC maintains the sea surface temperature anomaly cooling in the eastern Indian Ocean.},

Existing studies suggest that the Atlantic Nino may arise from local atmosphere-ocean interaction and is sometimes triggered by the Atlantic Meridional Mode (AMM), with overall weak ENSO contribution. By analyzing observational datasets and performing numerical model experiments, here we show that the Atlantic Nino can be induced by the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD). We find that the enhanced rainfall in the western tropical Indian Ocean during positive IOD weakens the easterly trade winds over the tropical Atlantic, causing warm anomalies in the central and eastern equatorial Atlantic basin and therefore triggering the Atlantic Nino. Our finding suggests that the cross-basin impact from the tropical Indian Ocean plays a more important role in affecting interannual climate variability than previously thought.},

abstract = {The Indian Ocean dipole (IOD) is one of the main modes characterizing the interannual variability of the large-scale ocean–atmosphere interaction in the equatorial zone of the World Ocean. A dipole manifests itself as an out-of-phase interannual fluctuation of the ocean–atmosphere characteristics in the western and eastern parts of the equatorial–tropical zone of the Indian Ocean. IOD can be a consequence of the ENSO (El Nino–Southern Oscillation) events in the Pacific Ocean, or it can be independent of them and arise due to the Indian Ocean inherent processes. Earlier, it was suggested that the generation of the long planetary waves in the Indian Ocean by the ENSO events is one of the mechanisms of the ENSO impact on the IOD. However, quite often, such a mechanism is not the case and IOD is generated itself as an independent Indian Ocean mode. We hypothesized that this generation is due to the growing oceanic disturbances, as a result of instability of the system of Indian Ocean zonal currents in the vicinity of the critical layer, in which the phase velocity of Rossby waves is equal to the average velocity of the zonal currents. In the present work, the study of the features of the formation of the critical layer in the equatorial–tropical zone of the Indian Ocean is continued using different oceanic re-analyses and standard theory of the Rossby waves. As a result of comparison of different re-analyses data with the RAMA (The Research Moored Array for African-Asian-Australian Monsoon Analysis and Prediction) measurements, the operative re-analysis ORAS5 output of European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) on potential temperature, salinity, and the zonal component of the currents' velocity for the period 1979–2018 was used. Monthly profiles of potential temperature, salinity, and the zonal component of the currents' velocity were selected from the ORAS5 archive for the sections situated between 7.5–15.5° S and 50–100° E. From these data and for each month, using the standard theory of planetary waves, the phase velocity of the lowest baroclinic mode of the Rossby long waves was calculated and the critical layers were determined. For each critical layer, its length was calculated. The obtained time series of the length of the critical layers were compared to the variability of dipole mode index (DMI). It is shown that the majority of the cases of the IOD generation as inherent (independent on the Pacific processes) mode were accompanied by the critical layer formation in the region of interest. Usually, the critical layers occur in spring, one to two months before the onset of the positive IOD events. This indicates that the presence of instability in the system of the zonal currents can be a reason for the generation of IOD and the asymmetry of the amplitude of the dipole mode index between positive and negative events. During the extremely intense ENSO event of 1997–1998, which was accompanied by the strong IOD event, the critical layer in the equatorial–tropical zone of the Indian Ocean was absent. This ENSO event generated the oceanic planetary waves at the eastern edge of the Indian Ocean. Therefore, it is shown that the above mechanism of the ENSO–IOD interaction is a reality.},

abstract = {This paper examines the impacts of Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) Mode on the upper ocean carbon cycle and its variability in the Indian Ocean with available biogeochemical observations and 60 years (1960–2019) of model outputs from a global ocean biogeochemical general circulation model. The upper ocean carbon cycle variability of the Indian Ocean is faithfully reproduced by the model when compared with available observations. The IOD leads to a substantial sea‐to‐air CO2 flux variability in the southeastern tropical Indian Ocean over a broad region (70–105°E, 0–20°S), with more focus near the coast of Java‐Sumatra due to the prevailing upwelling dynamics and associated westward propagating anomalies. The sea‐to‐air CO2 fluxes, surface ocean partial pressure of CO2 (pCO2), the concentration of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), and ocean alkalinity (ALK) range as much as ±1.0 mole m−2 year−1, ±20 $\mu$atm, ±35 $\mu$mole kg−1, and ±22 $\mu$mole kg−1 within 80–105°E, 0–10°S due to IOD. The DIC and ALK are significant drivers of pCO2 variability associated with IOD. The roles of temperature (T) and biology are found negligible. A relatively warm T and extremely high freshwater forcing make the southeastern tropical Indian Ocean carbon cycle variability submissive to DIC and ALK evolutions in contrast to the tropical eastern Pacific where changes in DIC and T dominate the pCO2 interannual variability. For the first time, this study provides a most comprehensive and extended analysis for the region while highlighting significant differences in carbon cycle variability of the eastern tropical Indian Ocean compared to that of the other parts of the global oceans.

abstract = {Differing from the Indian Ocean dipole (IOD) that has sea surface temperature anomalies (SSTAs) of opposing signs over the tropical southeastern and western Indian Ocean, a tripole pattern, characterized by positive (negative) SSTAs over the tropical central (southeastern and western) Indian Ocean, is observed and named the Indian Ocean tripole (IOT). This study proposes the concept of the IOT and further investigates the associated atmospheric and oceanic processes. Using empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis, the IOT (IOD) is represented by the third (second) leading mode of the monthly SSTAs in the tropical Indian Ocean, explaining about 8.2\% (10.3\%) of the total variance. The IOT peaks in boreal summer, while the IOD has its mature phase in boreal fall. The spatio-temporal differences, together with the significant separation of these two EOF patterns, illustrate that the IOT is independent of the IOD. Heat budget diagnoses indicate that the anomalous temperature over the southeastern and western Indian Ocean is mainly generated by the net heat flux during April–May and by the total ocean advection in June–August. In contrast, the anomalous temperature is mainly driven by the advection of the mean temperature by the anomalous current in April and the residual term in May–June over the central Indian Ocean, which is replaced by advection of the anomalous temperature by the mean zonal current in July.},

abstract = {Previous studies suggest that the winter surface freshening in the southeastern Arabian Sea (SEAS) contributes to the development of very high Sea Surface Temperatures (SST) thereby influencing the following summer monsoon onset. Here, we use forced and coupled simulations with a regional ocean general circulation model to explore the SEAS Sea Surface Salinity (SSS) variability mechanisms and impact on the monsoon. Both configurations capture the main SEAS oceanographic features, and confirm that the winter SSS decrease results from horizontal advection of Bay of Bengal freshwater by the cyclonic circulation around India during fall. A coupled model sensitivity experiment where salinity has no effect on mixing indicates that the salinity stratification reduces the SEAS mixed layer cooling by vertical processes by 3 °C seasonally. Salinity however enhances mixed layer cooling by a similar amount through concentrating negative winter surface heat fluxes into a thinner mixed layer, resulting in no climatological impact on SST and summer monsoon rainfall. The Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) is the main driver of the winter SEAS SSS interannual variability (r $\sim$ 0.8). Salty anomalies generated in the western Bay of Bengal during fall by positive IOD events are indeed transported by the cyclonic climatological coastal circulation, reaching the SEAS in winter. By this time, warm IOD-induced SST anomalies in the SEAS are already decaying, and the SEAS SSS anomalies hence do not contribute to their development. Overall, our model results suggest a weak climatological and interannual impact of the SEAS winter freshening on local SST and following monsoon onset.},

abstract = {The Indonesian Throughflow (ITF) plays an important role in the heat flux and water budget between the Pacific and Indian oceans and may modulate climate variability. During the boreal winter monsoon, low-salinity, buoyant water carried from the Java Sea to the Southern Makassar Strait retards the sea-surface transport of the ITF, which may affect the Asian monsoon and climate change. However, observation records are inadequate to elucidate the marine environment around the Indonesian Seas. We analyzed coral Sr/Ca and $\delta$18 O from the Seribu Islands, Java Sea, and reconstructed sea-surface temperature (SST) and sea-surface salinity (SSS) for 1931–2002. The SST data indicate abrupt warming in the mid-1950s and, almost simultaneously, a rapid SSS shift to saline conditions. The relationships between SST around the Seribu Islands and climate variability in the Pacific and Indian oceans have changed after this abrupt warming events. Before the mid-1950s, during September to November, SST varied with the Indian Ocean Dipole, whereas El Nino–Southern Oscillation also affected SST variation after the mid-1950s. This abrupt change seems to be related to a regime shift in the tropical Pacific and Indian oceans, but there are no clear changes corresponding to other regime shifts such as that of 1970s. SSS variation exhibits no relationship with climatic factors, indicating that the dominant controlling factors of SST and SSS should be considered separately. Marine conditions in the Java Sea that affect the ITF show unique behavior, and further local studies in the Indonesian Seas are crucial to understand ITF behavior. Coral,},

abstract = {Based on the Argo and multi-satellite observations, this study investigates the asymmetric response of sea surface salinity (SSS) to two extreme positive and negative Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) events in the southern tropical Indian Ocean (TIO). During positive IOD events, the easterly wind anomalies trigger zonal freshwater advection along the equator, decreasing SSS, while cold sea surface temperature (SST) depress the convective precipitation in the southeastern TIO (SETIO), increasing the SSS. Contrast SSS anomalies along the equator and in the SETIO show opposite phases during positive and negative IOD events. These SSS anomalies have enhanced in recent years, reaching the strongest in the extreme negative IOD in 2016 and positive IOD in 2019. The case study shows that positive SSS anomalies occurred in the southern TIO during both positive and negative IOD events in 2016 and 2019, suggesting significant asymmetry in SSS. Analysis of the mixed layer salinity budget shows that the local precipitation and the entrainment associated with the upwelling Rossby waves played an essential role in the SSS increase in 2016, while the decreased precipitation and horizontal advection caused by the westward South Equatorial Current contributed to the SSS increase in 2019. Further analyses suggest that SSS response is more sensitive to thermocline shoaling than deepening, and SSS response to precipitation is greater at shallower mixed layer than at deeper ones, which is the main reason for the asymmetric response of the SSS to negative and positive IOD events.},

abstract = {The long-term trend of sea surface salinity (SSS) reveals an intensification of the global hydrological cycle due to human-induced climate change. This study demonstrates that SSS variability can also be used as a measure of terrestrial precipitation on interseasonal to interannual time scales, and to locate the source of moisture. Seasonal composites during El Nino–Southern Oscillation/Indian Ocean dipole (ENSO/IOD) events are used to understand the variations of moisture transport and precipitation over Australia, and their association with SSS variability. As ENSO/IOD events evolve, patterns of positive or negative SSS anomaly emerge in the Indo-Pacific warm pool region and are accompanied by atmospheric moisture transport anomalies toward Australia. During co-occurring La Nina and negative IOD events, salty anomalies around the Maritime Continent (north of Australia) indicate freshwater export and are associated with a significant moisture transport that converges over Australia to create anomalous wet conditions. In contrast, during co-occurring El Nino and positive IOD events, a moisture transport divergence anomaly over Australia results in anomalous dry conditions. The relationship between SSS and atmospheric moisture transport also holds for pure ENSO/IOD events but varies in magnitude and spatial pattern. The significant pattern correlation between the moisture flux divergence and SSS anomaly during the ENSO/IOD events highlights the associated ocean–atmosphere coupling. A case study of the extreme hydroclimatic events of Australia (e.g., the 2010/11 Brisbane flood) demonstrates that the changes in SSS occur before the peak of ENSO/IOD events. This raises the prospect that tracking of SSS variability could aid the prediction of Australian rainfall.},

The S-IOD matures in November– December, lagging the Indian Ocean dipole (IOD) mode derived from sea surface temperature (SST) by 2 months. For the period of observations, the S-IOD persists longer than the IOD, until the following September–October. Oscillations of the two S-IOD poles are governed by dif- ferent processes. Ocean advection associated with equa- torial current variability dominates the SSS anomalies of the northern pole, while surface freshwater flux variability plays a key role in the SSS anomalies of the southern pole, where anomalous precipitation is sustained by preformed sea surface temperature anomalies.

The seasonal MLS variation in the eastern equatorial Indian Ocean is driven strongly by salt advection associated with the Wyrtki Jet in spring and fall despite weak seasonal cycles of precipitation and evaporation over this region. Off the south Java coast, the MLS is the lowest in summer, due to the advection of freshwater southward associated with the meridional currents, whereas it reaches the maximum in fall, due to strong evaporation. During the negative Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD), the anomalous eastward currents transported high-salinity water to the east, generating positive MLS anomalies in the eastern tropical Indian Ocean.

abstract = {The monsoon reversal winds in different seasons and high influx of freshwater from various rivers make the Bay of Bengal (BoB) a unique region. Thus, the knowledge of the dynamics of the mixed layer over this region is very important to assess the climatic variation of the Indian subcontinent. A comprehensive study of the role of external forcing on the seasonal and interannual mixed layer depth (MLD) variability over the BoB is carried out for 36 years (1980–2015) using reanalysis products. A weak and strong seasonality of MLD is observed over the northern and the southern BoB (NBoB and SBoB) respectively. The partial correlation suggests that the net heat flux (Qnet) is the major contributor to the deepening of MLD over the NBoB, whereas the wind stress controls the deepening over the SBoB. The seasonal variability reveals the deepening of MLD during summer and winter monsoon and the shallowing during pre- and post-monsoon over the BoB. The relation of the interannual MLD variability and the different phases of the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) reveals that the negative phase of IOD is associated with deeper MLD over BoB while the positive phase of IOD depicts shallower MLD. In addition, the opposing characteristic of MLD is highly prominent during October-December. This is majorly contributed by variations related to the second downwelling Kelvin and associated Rossby waves over BoB for the opposing phases of the IOD years.},

The western warming and the associated convection induce easterly wind anomalies much before the significant eastern cooling during IOD years, which strongly supports the role of western warming in the IOD evolution. IOD years are characterized by anomalous thickening of summer BL over the Arabian Sea. The anomalous BL formation during IOD years is attributed to the anomalous negative Ekman pumping velocity in the Arabian Sea. This negative Ekman pumping velocity forced downwelling deepens isothermal layer depth and thickens the BL. In addition to this, strong precipitation during IOD years strengthened the stratification and supported the BL formation. These favourable conditions for BL formation are absent during El Ni˜no years. Anomalous BL is mainly responsible for the deepening of thermocline and subsurface warming in the Arabian Sea during IOD years.},

@article{Sari2020,
abstract = {Surface chlorophyll-a (chl-a) variation in the Southeastern Tropical Indian Ocean (SETIO) shows different patterns in response to the various types of the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) events. Thirteen years of remotely sensed surface chl-a data from the Moderate- resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) were used to eval- uate interannual surface chl-a variation in the SETIO. During the period of analysis (January 2003-December 2015), there were three canonical positive IOD (pIOD) and four pIOD Modoki events. It is found that the spatial patterns of surface chl-a variation were coherent with the pattern of surface wind anomaly, and the sea surface temperature anomaly (SSTA). During canonical pIOD events, high chl-a concentrations were observed in the vicinity of the Sunda Strait and along the coast of western tip of the Java Island around the Cilacap region. Meanwhile, during pIOD Modoki event, surface chl-a concentration was relatively higher and dis- tributed wider than those observed during canonical pIOD event. The analysis shows that relatively weak upwelling event indicated by a deep isothermal layer depth (ILD) during pIOD Modoki events combined with thin barrier layer thickness (BLT) and deep mixed layer provides a favourable condition for an increase in surface chl- a in the SETIO region. Meanwhile, strong upwelling as indicated by shallow ILD combined with thick BLT and shallow mixed layer prevents surface chl-a to increase during canonical pIOD events.},

abstract = {The present study was carried out to find the variability of chloro- phyll-a (chl-a) concentration, sea surface temperature (SST), and sea surface height anomalies (SSHa) during 2003–2014, covering the Bay of Bengal (BoB) and Arabian Sea (AS) waters. These parameters were linked with El Nino, La Nina, and Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) years. The observed results during 2003–2014 were evaluated and it was found that the monthly mean value for 12-year data ranged as follows: chl-a (0.11–0.46 mg m−3 ), SST (27–31 °C), and SSHa (−0.2 to 20 cm). The annual mean range of chl-a for 12-year data was 0.1–0.23 mg m−3 , the SST range was 27–28 °C, and the SSHa range was 2.14–13.91 cm. It has been observed that with the SST range of 27–28 °C and the SSHa range of 7–9 cm, the chl-a concentration enhanced to 0.20– 0.23 mg m−3 . With a higher SST range of 28–29 °C and with a positive SSHa range of 11–14 cm, the chl-a concentration appeared to be low (0.17–0.18 mgm−3 ). During normal years, SSHa was positive with the >5 to <10 cm range during the months of April–June, which coin- cided with an increase in SST, >2 to <4 °C. During the normal years, SSHa (>−0.2 to <−10 cm) was observed to be negative during October–December, with a decrease in SST (<3 °C) observed. The high monthly mean chl-a concentration (>0.3 to <0.5 mg m−3 ) was noticed during December–February in the BoB and AS. Compared to the BoB chl-a range (<0.4 mg m−3 ), a high chl-a concentration was observed in AS (>0.4 mg m−3 ). However, during the phenomenon years, the study area had experienced low chl-a (<0.2 mg m−3 ), high SST (>5 °C), and more positive SSHa (>10 to <20 cm) during January– March and October–December in AS and BoB. The present study infers that a positive IOD leads to low chl-a concentration (<2 mg m−3 ) and low primary productivity in AS. El Nino caused the down-welling process, it results in a low chl-a concentration (<1 mg m−3 ) in BoB and AS. La Nina caused the upwelling process, and it results in a high chl-a concentration (>2.0 mg m−3 ) in BoB and AS. In the recent past years (2003–2014), the intensity and frequency of El Nino, La Nina, and IOD have been increasing, evidenced with few studies, and have impacts on the Indian Ocean climate. Therefore, the influences of the relative changes of these phenomena on the BoB and AS need to be under- stood for productivity assessment and ocean state monitoring.},

abstract = {Twelve years of remotely sensed all-sat merged chlorophyll-a concentration unveils strong signatures of chlorophyll-a blooms along the south Java coast. An unprecedented three-times increase in chlorophyll-a concentration is significantly observed along the south Java coast during the southeast monsoon (June–October) than the northwest monsoon (December–April). The multiple regression analysis of dynamic factors evidently indicates that seasonal upwelling is predominantly controlled by the seasonally evolving coastal eddies associated with the seasonally reversing south Java coastal currents (SJCC) and Ekman mass transport (EMT), followed by the relative roles of sea surface temperature (SST) and wind stress curl. The eddy-induced upwelling and EMT-induced coastal upwelling lead to chlorophyll-a blooms during southeast monsoon, well-supported by the entrainment of cold and saline waters (thermocline doming) with low spiciness. On the other hand, the coastal eddies associated with SJCC and SST anomalies play a significant role in modulating the interannual surface chlorophyll-a variability in the domain. Intense chlorophyll-a blooms are observed during the positive IOD years, whereas the least chlorophyll-a concentration is observed during the negative IOD years. The unprecedentedly least chlorophyll-a concentrations during 2010 and 2016 are attributed to the intense and prolonged surface marine heatwaves.},

abstract = {The Asian–Australian Monsoon (AAM), the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), and the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) have been known to induce variability in ocean surface characteristics along the southern coast of Lesser Sunda Island (LSI). However, previous studies used low spatial resolution data and little Ekman dynamics analysis. This study aims to investigate the direct influence of AAM winds on ocean surface conditions and to determine how ENSO and IOD affect the ocean surface and depth with higher spatial resolution data. In addition, the variability in Ekman dynamics is also described along with the inconsistent relationship between wind and sea surface temperature (SST) in four different areas. The results indicate that persistent southeasterly winds are likely to induce low SST and chlorophyll-a blooms. Based on the interannual variability, the positive chlorophyll-a (up to 0.5 mg m−3) and negative SST (reaching −1.5 °C) anomalies observed in the El Nino of 2015 coincide with +IOD, which also corroborates positive wind stress and Ekman Mass Transport (EMT) anomalies. In contrast, the La Nina of 2010 coincides with -IOD, and positive SST and negative chlorophyll-a anomalies (more than 1.5 °C and −0.5 mg m−3 respectively) were observed. Furthermore, we found that southern coast of Java and Bali Island have a different generated mechanism that controls SST variability.},

abstract = {Seasonal and interannual variations of chlorophyll- a (chl- a ) in the upper Gulf of Thailand (uGoT) were obtained using new regionally tuned algorithms applied to Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer-Aqua. This long time-series (2003-2017) data were analyzed in the context of variations in environmental conditions associated with the Southeast Asian Monsoon. Chl- a distribution patterns were distinct for the non-monsoon (NOM), southwest-monsoon (SWM), and northeast-monsoon (NEM) seasons. During the SWM/NEM, high/low chl- a concentrations were associated with high/low precipitation and river discharge. During the NOM chl- a concentrations were generally low, because of low precipitation. In general, chl- a variability was tightly coupled to discharge from the Chao Phraya and Tha Chin rivers. Chl- a concentrations were generally higher in the north, but chl -a accumulation in the east/west of the uGoT could be linked to piling of freshwater to the east/west during the SWM/NEM caused by changes in wind direction and the reversal of currents. Interannual changes in chl -a were attributed to El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) rather than Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) driven changes in precipitation, river discharge, and wind patterns. During the SWM, positive/negative chl -a anomalies coincided with high/low precipitation and river discharge during La Nina/El Nino. During the NEM, positive/negative chl -a anomaly coincided with high/low river discharge and strong/weak wind during La Nina/El Nino. Meanwhile, during NOM, positive chl -a anomaly could be attributed to anomalous high wind speed and precipitation during El Nino.},

@article{Setiawan2020,
abstract = {Long-termsatellite data are used to investigate the variability ofocean surface chlorophyll-a (chl-a) concentration in the Halmahera Sea (HS) under influence of the Australian-Indonesian Monsoon (AIM), the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), and the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD). In this study, we first analysed the seasonal variability of chl-a,and then examine the relationship between surface chl-a, sea surface temperature (SST), and sea surface wind stress in the area. Our results suggest that prevailing southeasterly winds play a fundamental role in generating chl-ablooms in theHS. Particularly on a seasonal timescale, through the mechanism of Ekman mass transport, strengthening of southeasterly wind stress during the Southeast Monsoon season (June - August) produces enhanced chl-a concentrations associated with ocean surface cooling in the area of study. On the other hand, the chl-a bloom completely diminishes during the Northwest Monsoon season (December - February) due to weakening of wind stress and Ekman transport. On an interannual timescale, sea level pressure and wind stress are coherent with ENSO and IOD phases. During El Nino and positive IOD events (La Nina and negative IOD events), both sea level pressure and wind stress greatly increase (decrease) over the HS. These conditions cause an anomaly in southerly (northerly) wind stress, which is favourable to an enhancement (reduction) of the chl- a concentration in the region. This study demonstrates that sea level pressure and wind stress are the critical factors in determining the magnitude of chl-a bloom in the HS.},

abstract = {This study investigates the role of driving atmospheric forces [winds, net heat flux, and evaporation–precipitation (E–P)] and the possible mechanisms on the mixed layer depth (MLD) spatiotemporal variability in the Bay of Bengal (BoB) using a finer-resolution ($\sim$ 9 km) Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS). The model simulation is configured for 2004–2012 with initial and boundary conditions from Mercator Ocean data, atmospheric forcing from ECMWF, and climatological river input. Comparison with in situ observations shows that the model well produces the mean seasonal characteristics of MLD variability. Spatial correlations have been carried out between the atmospheric forces and MLD to determine the relative influence of these forces on the MLD variability. During the southwest monsoon, strong southwesterly wind plays a crucial role in deepening the MLD up to 80 m in the southern BoB. In winter, the decrease in net heat flux and the increase in positive E–P in the upper ocean deepen the MLD in the northern bay to a depth of $\sim$ 60 m. However, the high density stratification in the northern BoB due to the large inflow of freshwater from various rivers limits the seasonality of MLD, particularly in the northern BoB. The positive correlation between E–P and MLD suggests that the advection of the freshwater plume by the southward East India Coastal Current (EICC) forms a thin mixed layer in the western BoB. The model results well captured the contrasting Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) years and reveal that the interannual variability of MLD seems to be connected to the IOD events in the BoB. The MLD is shallow during the positive phase of IOD (pIOD) in 2006, whereas the mean MLD is more profound ($\sim$ 50 m) during the negative period of IOD (nIOD) in 2010. In pIOD years, the anomalous upwelling coastal Kelvin waves (KWs) propagate, reflect Rossby waves, and trigger upwelling to form a shallow MLD throughout the BoB. The positive net heat flux at the air-sea interface also plays a dominant role in the MLD shoaling in pIOD year, as shortwave radiation increases and exceeds the cooling effect of latent heat flux during this period.},

abstract = {This paper examines the interannual variability of latent (LE) and sensible (H) heat fluxes over the North Indian Ocean for the summer season (June, July, August), that show positive linear trends during 1958–2017. Using Air-Sea Flux (OAFlux) from NCEP/NCAR reanalysis-I, the variability and trends in LE and H heat fluxes are compared with changes in the position and pressure of the South Asia Low (SAL). Investigation of interactions between the air-sea heat fluxes and SAL pressure center through correlations analysis and with analysis of composites of humidity gradient, temperature gradient and vector wind fields is carried out. The results show that the SAL plays an important role in the variability of air-sea heat fluxes over North Indian Ocean. There is a negative correlation between SAL pressure and its latitude position. A change of the SAL from a north location to a south location induces changes in North Indian Ocean surface winds, humidity and temperature. These, combined with sea surface warming trends, produce trends in summer latent and sensible heat fluxes.},

abstract = {This study aimed to evaluate the seasonal variability in surface heat content in the Arabian Gulf (AG) based on hydrographic data. The ocean heat content (OHC) was initially estimated from surface to maximum depth (75 m) to show the seasonal variability, where the seasonal temperature reaches to that depth. Then OHC was re-estimated from the surface to a depth of 35 m, which represents the average depth of AG, to obtain accurate horizontal distributions. Results showed that during winter, the northern part of AG experiences the lowest OHC compared to the southeastern part. The monthly spatial average implies that the highest OHC of AG water was in September and October, while the lowest heat content was found in February and March. However, the OHC horizontal distributions were almost the same for the entire gulf during summer. In general, there was increasing in the OHC in the southeast region of the gulf. OHC anomalies are concentrated in the northern region of the AG, while the southeastern part near the Strait of Hormuz has the lowest values. Regarding heat flux, the highest heat gains were during spring, while the highest loss was in autumn. The water exchange between the AG and the Indian Ocean through the Strait of Hormuz may play a major role in the seasonal variability in OHC.},

abstract = {Bay of Bengal (BoB) is one of the most cyclone prone regions in the world. Cyclones receive energy from warm ocean surface waters and the change in cyclone activity generally depends on the change in heat energy available in the upper ocean. Here, we use satellite-based Modern Era Retrospective-analysis for Research and Applications dataset, and reanalysis of Simple Ocean Data Assimila- tion (SODA) and European Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecasts–Ocean ReAnalysis System 4 (ECMWF–ORAS4) to analyse the oceanic heat content (OHC) and heat flux to identify sources of the additional heat input in the region during the period 1980–2014. It has been observed that during 1999–2014, heat energy is mainly stored in the southern and northwestern parts of the bay and it shows an increasing trend in both regions. In the analysis of OHC, the European Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) data show a trend of −0.87 × 1018 J/month during 1980–1998 and 7.58 × 1018 J/month during 1999–2014 whereas, the SODA data show a trend of 0.94 × 1018 J/month during 1980–1998 and 5.25 × 1018 J/month during 1999–2014. It is found that many cyclones are seeded in the southeastern bay and intensified over the northwestern bay, consistent with the increase in cyclone heat potential and the upper ocean heat content (UOHC) in those regions. The heat flux in the bay is primarily governed by the heat entering the eastern side and leaving through the western side. In 1999–2014, the incoming heat flux along the eastern boundary has increased sig- nificantly (from 0.18 × 1012 to 0.57 × 1012 W/month), indicating that more heat enters the region. Furthermore, a significant reduction in the outgoing heat flux along the western boundary has also been found from the analysis. These processes trap the heat and thereby contributing to the increase in OHC in the bay. The heat flux through the bay is mainly linked with conditions prevailing over Pacific Ocean, such as, the heat influx of BoB decreases during El-Nino and increases during La-Nina years.},

abstract = {A new 2° resolution global climatology of the mixed layer depth (MLD) based on individual profiles is constructed. Previous global climatologies have been based on temperature or density-gridded climatologies. The criterion selected is a threshold value of temperature or density from a near-surface value at 10 m depth (ΔT = 0.2°C or Δσθ = 0.03 kg m−3). A validation of the temperature criterion on moored time series data shows that the method is successful at following the base of the mixed layer. In particular, the first spring restratification is better captured than with a more commonly used larger criteria. In addition, we show that for a given 0.2°C criterion, the MLD estimated from averaged profiles results in a shallow bias of 25\% compared to the MLD estimated from individual profiles. A new global seasonal estimation of barrier layer thickness is also provided. An interesting result is the prevalence in mid- and high-latitude winter hemispheres of vertically density-compensated layers, creating an isopycnal but not mixed layer. Consequently, we propose an optimal estimate of MLD based on both temperature and density data. An independent validation of the maximum annual MLD with oxygen data shows that this oxygen estimate may be biased in regions of Ekman pumping or strong biological activity. Significant differences are shown compared to previous climatologies. The timing of the seasonal cycle of the mixed layer is shifted earlier in the year, and the maximum MLD captures finer structures and is shallower. These results are discussed in light of the different approaches and the choice of criterion.},

@article{Tomita2021,
abstract = {The reliability of surface net heat flux data obtained from the latest satellite-based estimation [the third-generation Japanese Ocean Flux Data Sets with Use of Remote Sensing Observations (J-OFURO3, V1.1)] was investigated. Three metrics were utilized: (1) the global long-term (30 years) mean for 1988–2017, (2) the local accuracy evaluation based on comparison with observations recorded at buoys located at 11 global oceanic points with varying climatological characteristics, and (3) the physical consistency with the freshwater balance related to the global water cycle. The globally averaged value of the surface net heat flux of J-OFURO3 was −22.2 W m −2 , which is largely imbalanced to heat the ocean surface. This imbalance was due to the turbulent heat flux being smaller than the net downward surface radiation. On the other hand, compared with the local buoy observations, the average difference was −5.8 W m −2 , indicating good agreement. These results indicate a paradox of the global surface net heat flux. In relation to the global water cycle, the balance between surface latent heat flux (ocean evaporation) and precipitation was estimated to be almost 0 when river runoff from the land was taken into consideration. The reliability of the estimation of the latent heat flux was reconciled by two different methods. Systematic ocean-heating biases by surface sensible heat flux (SHF) and long wave radiation were identified. The bias in the SHF was globally persistent and especially large in the mid- and high latitudes. The correction of the bias has an impact on improving the global mean net heat flux by +5.5 W m −2 . Furthermore, since J-OFURO3 SHF has low data coverage in high-latitudes areas containing sea ice, its impact on global net heat flux was assessed using the latest atmospheric reanalysis product. When including the sea ice region, the globally averaged value of SHF was approximately 1.4 times larger. In addition to the bias correction mentioned above, when assuming that the global ocean average of J3 SHF is 1.4 times larger, the net heat flux value changes to the improved value (−11.3 W m −2 ), which is approximately half the original value (−22.2 W m −2 ).},

@article{Tomita2019,
abstract = {Accurate observational estimation of the ocean surface heat, momentum, and freshwater fluxes is crucial for studies of the global climate system. Estimating surface flux using satellite remote sensing techniques is one possible answer to this challenge. In this paper, we introduce J-OFURO3, a third-generation data set developed by the Japanese Ocean Flux Data Sets with Use of Remote-Sensing Observations (J-OFURO) research project, which represents a significant improvement from older data sets as the result of research and development conducted from several perspectives. J-OFURO3 offers data sets for surface heat, momentum, freshwater fluxes, and related parameters over the global oceans (except regions of sea ice) from 1988 to 2013. The surface flux data, based on a 0.25° grid system, have a higher spatial resolution and are more accurate than the previous efforts. This has been achieved through the adopting of the state-of-the-art algorithms that estimate the near-surface air specific humidity and the improvement of techniques using observations from multi-satellite sensors. Comparisons with in situ observations using a systematic system developed along with the J-OFURO3 data set confirmed these improvements in accuracy, as did comparisons with other data sets. J-OFURO3 data are of good quality, facilitating a clearer understanding of more fine-scale ocean–atmosphere features (such as ocean fronts, mesoscale eddies, and geographic features) and their effects on surface fluxes. The information contained in this long-term (26 year) data set is demonstrably beneficial to understanding climate change and its relationship to oceans and the atmosphere.},

@article{Chacko2022,
abstract = {This study examines the effect of surface currents on the bulk algorithm calculation ofwind stress estimated using the scatterometer data during 2007–2020 in the Indian Ocean. In the study region as a whole, the wind stress decreased by 5.4\% by including currents in the wind stress equation. The most significant reduction in the wind stress is found along the most energetic regions with strong currents such as Somali Current, Equatorial Jets, and Agulhas retroflection. The highest reduction of 11.5\% is observed along the equator where the Equatorial Jets prevail. A sensitivity analysis has been carried out for the study region and for different seasons to assess the relative impact of winds and currents in the estimation of wind stress by changing the winds while keeping the currents constants and vice versa. The inclusion of currents decreased the wind stress (consistent with scatterometer winds) and this decrease is prominent when the currents are stronger. This study showed that the equatorial Indian Ocean is the most sensitive region where the current can impact wind stress estimation. The results showed that uncertainties in the wind stress estimations are quite large at regional levels and hence better representation of wind stress incorporating ocean currents should be considered in the ocean/climatic models for accurate air-sea interaction studies that are not based on remotely sensed winds.},

abstract = {Abstract An extreme positive Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) event occurred in 2019 boreal autumn, which has induced severe climate impacts around the Indian Ocean basin. In this study, the cause for 2019 IOD event and the related mechanism are explored. We find that the remarkable strengthening of Australian high and weakening of sea level pressure over South China Sea/Philippine Sea have been evidently visible since May 2019. Such a record-breaking interhemispheric pressure gradient (IHPG) induced northward cross-equatorial flow over the western Maritime Continent, which triggered strong wind-evaporation-SST and thermocline feedbacks in 2019. In addition to 2019 case, historical IOD events are highly correlated with IHPG from boreal late spring to summer. We show that skillful IHPG prediction can be made in March by European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts seasonal forecast system, which makes it quite possible for the early warning of extreme IOD events by two to three seasons ahead.},

Under the assumption of white noise, it is possible to test the significance of each regression coefficient, evaluate the uncertainty/goodness of fit, and use the fitted model for predicting novel outcomes.
